‚úÖ CHANGES PUSHED!

==============================================
WHAT CHANGED
==============================================

‚úÖ Removed migrations from entrypoint
‚úÖ Now only runs: collectstatic + gunicorn
‚úÖ Fast startup (under 2 minutes)

==============================================
CRITICAL: REMOVE PRE-DEPLOY COMMAND
==============================================

‚ö° DO THIS NOW IN RENDER DASHBOARD:

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click: "Girjasoft-hrms" service  
3. Click: "Settings" tab
4. Scroll to: "Pre-Deploy Command"
5. DELETE everything (make it blank)
6. Click: "Save Changes"
7. Wait for auto-deploy or click "Manual Deploy"

‚ùå WITHOUT THIS FIX, APP WILL FAIL!

==============================================
WHAT HAPPENS NOW
==============================================

1. Render auto-deploys your code
2. Runs collectstatic (quick!)
3. Starts gunicorn immediately
4. Port gets detected (no timeout!)
5. App goes live! üéâ

==============================================
DEMO DATA
==============================================

After app is live:
- Go to your app URL
- Login page loads
- Use UI to load demo data
- Or run migrations manually if needed
