ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX NEEDED IN RENDER:

===================================================
CURRENT ISSUE
===================================================

Your app IS LIVE but showing errors because:
1. ALLOWED_HOSTS is set to "*.onrender.com" (wrong format)
2. Migrations were commented out (just fixed in code)

===================================================
WHAT TO DO NOW
===================================================

Go to Render Dashboard:
1. Open "Girjasoft-hrms" service
2. Click "Settings" tab  
3. Find "Environment Variables"
4. Find "ALLOWED_HOSTS"
5. DELETE that variable OR change to: ALLOWED_HOSTS=*
6. Save changes
7. Wait for redeploy (happens automatically)

===================================================
ALTERNATIVE (EASIER)
===================================================

Just DELETE the ALLOWED_HOSTS variable entirely!
Your settings.py already has default ALLOWED_HOSTS=["*"]

===================================================
AFTER THE FIX
===================================================

âœ… App will stop showing DisallowedHost errors
âœ… Database tables will be created (migrations uncommented)
âœ… App will work properly!
