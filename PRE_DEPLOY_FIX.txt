🔍 IMPORTANT: Check your Pre-Deploy Command in Render!

Since migrations are now in entrypoint.sh, you might want to remove or update 
the Pre-Deploy Command in Render Dashboard.

Current setup in entrypoint.sh:
✅ Runs makemigrations
✅ Runs migrate
✅ Runs collectstatic

IF you have Pre-Deploy Command set to: python3 manage.py migrate
→ This is REDUNDANT and might cause conflicts
→ Consider removing it from Render settings

TO FIX:
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Click your "Girjasoft-hrms" web service
3. Click "Settings" tab
4. Scroll to "Pre-Deploy Command"
5. Either DELETE it or change to just: true
6. Save changes
7. Manual deploy or wait for auto-deploy

This will prevent double migrations and let entrypoint.sh handle it properly.
