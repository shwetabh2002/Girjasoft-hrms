# ✅ Your deployment is configured correctly!

## Current Configuration:
- ✅ Entrypoint uses `PORT=${PORT:-10000}` (matches Render docs)
- ✅ Binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT` (required by Render)
- ✅ Uses `exec` for proper process management
- ✅ Runs migrations before starting

## What to do now:

1. **Check Render Dashboard:**
   - Go to your web service "Girjasoft-hrms"
   - Click "Events" tab
   - Look for the deployment status

2. **Expected Logs:**
   ```
   Waiting for database to be ready...
   Applying migrations...
   Starting gunicorn on port 10000...
   [INFO] Starting gunicorn ...
   ```

3. **If it fails:**
   - Check the error message in logs
   - Common issues:
     - Database not connected (wait for PostgreSQL to be ready)
     - Static files issue
     - Python dependencies missing

4. **If it succeeds:**
   - Visit your URL: https://girjasoft-hrms.onrender.com
   - Should see the login page!

## Troubleshooting:

If still seeing "no port detected":
- Make sure the latest code is deployed (check commit in Events)
- Wait for build to complete (can take 10-15 min)
- Check if logs show "Starting gunicorn on port..."
